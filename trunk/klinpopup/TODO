goals for the next release (0.3.2)

-make use of inotify

SAMBA problems: -%f between samba itself are only underlines
                 (fixed in 3.0.11)
                -sending nearly every character except the euro sign works?
                -since 3.0.12 (e.g. SUSE 9.3) %m isn't replaced by the netbios name anymore but
                 by the IP of the client (will be fixed in next release)
                -since 3.0.15pre2 smbctx->workgroup not initialized with own workgroup
                 (autodetection does not work)

later/not so important
-check if cached servers are still good?
-sending messages with libsmbclient really not possible?
-improve remembering and restoring tool-, menu-, statusbar status
-improve spec file (other dists than SuSE?)

always:
-translation
-documentation

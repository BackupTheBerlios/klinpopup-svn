With this program you can receive and send popup messages like e.g.
with net send from a windows computer.

Features:
-can start docked only
-adjustable new message signaling (e.g. sound, tray pix, activate window)
Wow!

For this to work you must configure samba correctly (e.g. name resolution).
Add or change the line smb.conf:
message command = sh -c '_PATH_TO_/receivepopup.sh "%f" "%m" "%I" "%s"' &
(of course the real path for _PATH_TO_)

Then you should create the appropriate directory where the messages go to.
mkdir -vp -m 0777 /var/lib/klinpopup

That's it! Now you can stress the nerves of your colleagues or so.
